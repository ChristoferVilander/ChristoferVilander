### Hey ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub Page. I'm a PO for a European eCommerce Site, who occasionally writes a line of code or two, preferably HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here you'll mostly find repositories of different stuff I created out of "experimental" purpose, basically just to learn a bit more about how the web works, piece by piece.
