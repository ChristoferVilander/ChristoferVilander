ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

Welcome to my GitHub Page. I'm a Product Manager for a European Retailer who during my spare time like to digg into coding, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Lately, I've been diving into the world of .Net / C#. Here, you'll find repositories born out of experimentation â€“ my way of unraveling the intricacies of the web, one piece at a time.
